# CC_Statistics
Companion problem sets for [Crash Course Statistics](https://thecrashcourse.com/topic/statistics/), which can also be found on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNM_Y-bUAhblSAdWRnmBUcr).

This series of problem sets is designed to be a companion to the Crash Course Statistics Youtube video series. It is designed for students who have some experience with python, but no experience with pandas or matplotlib. It is not finished as of yet, but I will update it as I am able. The first 6 problem sets were created in Rmarkdown using reticulate for the python code. However, after problem set 6, I discovered you could do something similar with python and Quarto. So starting at problem set 7, I generate the problems sets using the quarto extension of Visual Studio Code. At some point I will go back and transition the first six problem sets to Quarto, but that is a task for a later date.  

# Required Packages

## R Packages (PS1-6)
rmarkdown, knitr, reticulate

## Python
numpy, pandas, matplotlib, random

# Data
I would encourage you to pick your own data set to use for these problem sets. However, the data used as an example are [Housing Prices in New England](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/htagholdings/property-sales).
