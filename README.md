# CC_Statistics
Companion problem sets for [Crash Course Statistics](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNM_Y-bUAhblSAdWRnmBUcr) on Youtube.

This series of problem sets is designed to be a companion to the Crash Course Statistics Youtube video series. It is designed for students who have some experience with python, but no experience with pandas or It is not finished as of yet, but I will update it as I am able. The first 6 problem sets were created in Rmarkdown using reticulate for the python code. However, after problem set 6 I discovered you could do something similar with python+quarto. 

# Required Packages

## R Packages
