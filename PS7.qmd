# Introduction

Please watch [The Shape of Data: Distributions](https://youtu.be/bPFNxD3Yg6U/) before 

For most of this problem set, we will be generating our own data, so we won't need

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import numpy.random as rand
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


```

# Distributions

Use LaTeX to write equations:


# Correlation

Like you saw in the videos, 

$$
\chi' = \sum_{i=1}^n k_i s_i^2
$$
