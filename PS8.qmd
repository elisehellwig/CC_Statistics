# Introduction

Please watch [Correlation Does Not Equal Causation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtV-VYdNt_g&list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNM_Y-bUAhblSAdWRnmBUcr&index=9&t=1s) before starting the problem set.

# Setup

For this problem set we are going to load several new packages: `scikit-learn`, `statsmodels`, and `pydataset`.  We will use `scikit-learn`, and `statsmodels` for doing statistical analysis. Both of these packages contain much of the same functionality, but their focus is a little different. The `pydataset` contains datasets we will practice doing statistics with.

This problem set uses the 1990 California Housing dataset from `scikit-learn` as an example. 

```{python}
import pandas as pd  
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from pydataset import data
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing

# load housing data
ca_data = fetch_california_housing(as_frame=True)

# get documenation on housing data
ca_data.DESCR

#extract data frame
ca = ca_data.frame

```


# What Question Are You Asking?

Whenever you sit down to do statistics, it is always a good idea to keep in mind what question you are trying to answer. In general, there are two types of questions statisticians can ask: questions of prediction and questions of inference.

## Questions of prediction
Questions of prediction are questions that ask us to predict the outcome of a situation we do not know. For example, we may want to know how a student will do on a final, based on their grades during the rest of the class. We may want to predict which basketball team match-ups will be most competitive, so we don't buy tickets to a boring game. A very common prediction question is what will the weather be like tomorrow, or a week from tomorrow. For the diabetes dataset, we are interested in predicting how quickly a person's diabetes will progress once diagnosed. This is particularly of interest because uncontrolled diabetes can have very severe health outcomes. 

## Questions of inference
Questions of inference are questions about how the world works. For example, we may want to know what effect an increase in atmospheric CO~2~ has summer temperatures in the Central Valley, or the severity of fire season. This won't tell us anything about what to wear next week, but it will inform whether or not we decide to move to a different state. For the diabetes dataset
