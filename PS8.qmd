# Introduction

Please watch [Correlation Does Not Equal Causation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtV-VYdNt_g&list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNM_Y-bUAhblSAdWRnmBUcr&index=9&t=1s) before starting the problem set.

# Setup

For this problem set we are going to load several new packages: `scikit-learn`, `statsmodels`, and `pydataset`.  We will use `scikit-learn`, and `statsmodels` for doing statistical analysis. Both of these packages contain much of the same functionality, but their focus is a little different. The `pydataset` contains datasets we will practice doing statistics with.

This problem set uses the 1990 California Housing dataset from `scikit-learn` as an example. 

```{python}
import pandas as pd  
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from pydataset import data
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing

# load housing data
ca_data = fetch_california_housing(as_frame=True)

#extract data frame
ca = ca_data.frame

# get documenation on housing data
ca.DESCR

```




```{python}
