# Introduction

Please watch [Controlled Experiments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkBDa-ICvyY&list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNM_Y-bUAhblSAdWRnmBUcr&index=10),

before doing this problem set. This problem set does not require any 
coding. However, that does not mean it is less important than the any of the 
other problem sets. In fact, it is probably more important. There is an often 
quoted adage in statistics: "Talking to a statistician after you finished your 
experiment is like talking to a doctor at an autopsy." Statistics is not a cure 
for poor study design. Rather good study design enables you to do (any) statistics.


# Study Types

Broadly speaking there are two study types: experimental studies and observational
studies. Experimental studies involve some sort of artificial manipulation of
the study subjects or their environment. This could be as inocuous as having someone use a step tracking app on their phone or as intensive as a multi-step cancer treatment. Because the researchers conducting the experiment are 

Observational studies do just that, they observe. They do not try to change 
anything about the study subjects or their environment, they just record data on
what is already happening. In some cases, like with wildlife observation,
researchers take great pains to avoid influencing their subjects. 

Observational studies do still require some oversight, especially when the study
subjects are humans. However, 

- Experiemental Studies
  - Tend to be shorter term
  - More restrictions/ethical concerns
  - Statistics can be less complicated
  - Tend to be more expensive
- Observational Studies
  - Can be long term
  - Fewer restrictions, except in the case of human subjects
  - Statistical analysis tends to be more complicated
  - Often times cost less given the same amount of data generated


# Experimental Studies

The gold standard of experimental studies are double-blinded randomized controlled
experiments.
