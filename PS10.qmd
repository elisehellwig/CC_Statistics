# Introduction

Please watch [Controlled Experiments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkBDa-ICvyY&list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNM_Y-bUAhblSAdWRnmBUcr&index=10),

before doing this problem set. This problem set does not require any 
coding. However, that does not mean it is less important than the any of the 
other problem sets. In fact, it is probably more important. There is an often 
quoted adage in statistics: "Talking to a statistician after you finished your 
experiment is like talking to a doctor at an autopsy." Statistics is not a cure 
for poor study design. Rather good study design enables you to do (any) statistics.


# Study Types

Broadly speaking there are two study types: experimental studies and observational
studies. Experimental studies involve some sort of artificial manipulation of
the study subjects or their environment. This could be as inocuous as having someone use a step tracking app on their phone or as intensive as a multi-step cancer treatment. Because the researchers conducting the experiment are 

Observational studies do just that, they observe. They do not try to change 
anything about the study subjects or their environment, they just record data on
what is already happening. In some cases, like with wildlife observation,
researchers take great pains to avoid influencing their subjects. 

Observational studies do still require some oversight, especially when the study
subjects are humans. However, 

- Experiemental Studies
  - Tend to be shorter term
  - More restrictions/ethical concerns
  - Statistics can be less complicated
  - Tend to be more expensive
- Observational Studies
  - Can be long term
  - Fewer restrictions, except in the case of human subjects
  - Statistical analysis tends to be more complicated
  - Often times cost less given the same amount of data generated


# Experimental Studies

Double-blinded randomized controlled experiments are the gold standard of 
experimental study design. However, not every study can meet that standard, and 
even fewer actually do. The key is to design your study check as many of those
boxes as possible. Interestingly enough 

## Controlled

## Randomized

## (Double) Blinded

# Observational Studies

Sometimes it is not ethical to do an experiment, or even if it is ethical, it 
it may not be legal, practical, or possible. There are plenty of 
-   Impact of greenspace on mental health
-   Impact of marraige on life expectancy
-   Relationship between media consumption and vaccination status

Any study looking at data from the past is going to be inherently observational.
Paleontology has shaped how we understand our world and our place in it. 
Studies in about the natural world are also predominantly observational, because 
it is almost impossible to manipulate systems that are so extensive in space and
time. 

Finally, sometimes we aren't trying to answer a question that requires an
experiment. For example, how long can whales hold their breath? Or where do the
bats go in the winter? Or how much of its life does a sea otter spend in the ocean?

## Case-Control

For situations where we want to do an experimental study, but can't due to 
ethical, legal, or practical reasons, a case-control study is often a good
alternative. A case-control study compares two groups of people that already fall
into an 'experimental' or 'control' group. Because we did not assign people to 
one group or the other, and then apply a treatment, this is not an experiment.
However, it is often as close to an experiment as we can get. 

For example, say we wanted to look at the impact of cigarettes on the immune system. 
Given what we already know about the impact of cigarettes on other parts of 
the human body, it would be morally reprehensible to force someone to smoke 
cigarettes, even as part of a study. Instead what we can do is compare the 
immune systems of people who already either smoke or don't smoke. We just have 
to make sure each group constitutes a representative sample in all other ways 
besides smoking behavoir.

## Cross-sectional

## Longitudinal Study

Cohort study

## Case-Control

# Questions

1. Design an experimental study you would like to run. 
   a. What question are you trying to answer?
   b. What treatments would you include in the study?
   c. If you need to recruit subjects, how would you ensure they are a representative sample of the population?
   d. How would you go about randomizing the subjects in your study into experimental and control groups?
   e. Would it be possibly for your study subjects to be blind to the treatment? How would you go about accomplishing thats?
   f. Would it be possibly for your study to be double-blinded?
   g. What data would you collect? What data types would be included? How would you collect it?
   h. What restrictions might you face and what ethical concerns would you need to consider?
2. Design an observational study you would like to run.
   a. What question are you trying to answer?
   b. Why wouldn't it be possible to answer this question with an experimental study?
   c. What type of study would it be (longitudinal, cross-sectional, or case-control)? Why are you choosing that type?
   d. If you need to recruit subjects, how would you ensure they are a representative sample of the population?
   e. What data would you collect? What data types would be included? How would you collect it?
   f. What confounding factors might limit your ability to draw conclusions about your data?
   g. What restrictions might you face and what ethical concerns would you need to consider?
